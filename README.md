# Multiple-Regression-model
This model is trained to predict the CO2 emissions of cars based on a dataset cars.csv using the multiple linear regression model. 

# Dataset used
It uses a dataset called cars.csv that has multiple attributes and the amount of CO2 emissions released by different car models in the year 2008. The dataset is attached.

# Libraries and modules used

The libraries used are pandas and sklearn From sklearn toolkit, the linear_model module is used, which contains the LinearRegression() object for the same.

# Conclusion
The model accurately predicts the CO2 emission for a new data point in the end, and the coefficients used by the model has also been printed. Hence, the coefficients used are correct.
